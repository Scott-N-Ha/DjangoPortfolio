This is my repo for learning Django along with Nick Walter on [Building a Personal Portfolio with Django](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/building-a-personal-portfolio-with-django?u=52983649)

To start the server, run: `python3.8 manage.py runserver`

To initialize the DB used by this project, run: `CREATE DATABASE djangoportfolio` in PostgreSQL

After adding a model to the app, to create a migraiton, run `python3.8 manage.py makemigrations`

To migrate the migrations, run `python3.8 manage.py migrate`

To create a `superuser`, run `python3.8 manage.py createsuperuser`
